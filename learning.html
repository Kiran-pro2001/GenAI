        <li>Context setting is the key to make understand LLM what is going on.</li>
        <li>Each previsous questions went as a context with the new question to the LLM Model. That's how, if the whole chat at ChatGPT, it remembers the context. </li>
        <li>So, in one window of ChatGPT, it gives all questions again with the new questions, so that it can remember the context and hence, give good response or the future upcoming questions it can tackle nicely. </li>
        <li>Now, All previous messages went to LLM Model.</li>
        <li>It will answer only, on which data set it gets traind. If trained wrong, it will give wrong answer. </li>
        <li>LLM model is giving good output, because at the end there are external tools that are helping.</li>
        <li>The basic principle of LLM is to predict. And this prediction become that much of accurate, then we thought that it is real. </li>
        <li>It can precit any text, it can't runt the program. And yeh predict kar karke aapko answer de dega.</li>
        <li>If the model is not trained on any data, then it can't tell the answer associate with that topic. For example, I launch a new programming language beastmode, then if I ask any help from chatcpt, it only don't knows about the event, so no issues...</li>
        <li><b>LLM Models can't calculate, LLM Models can't run the code. LLM Models can't tell whate is goin in real world.</b></li>
